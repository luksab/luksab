## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lukas and these are a couple of my favorite projects on here:
### [HiRISE](https://github.com/luksab/HiRISE)
is written in Opengl using my custom mini-engine and satellite images from [HiRISE](https://www.uahirise.org/):

### [My NixOS config](https://github.com/luksab/nixos)
was started in early August with help from [MayNiklas](http://github.com/mayNiklas/) and is now my main OS on most of my machines.

### [Discord bot](https://github.com/luksab/discord-bot)
is a bunch of fun to have with my friends and automated joke-responses.

### And loads of others
many written in Rust or JavaScript, my favorite languages right now.
