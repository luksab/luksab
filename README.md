## Hi there 👋 I'm Emma and here are a couple of my favorite projects:
### [Polyflare](https://github.com/luksab/polyflare)
My Bachelor's thesis is on using polynomial optics to efficiently render lens flares:

### [My NixOS config](https://github.com/luksab/nixos)
was started in early August of 2022 with help from [MayNiklas](http://github.com/mayNiklas/) and is now my main OS for servers.

### [Discord bot](https://github.com/luksab/lukasBot)
is a bunch of fun to have with my friends and automated joke-responses.

### And loads of others
many written in Rust or JavaScript, my favorite languages right now.
